# Safari
A safari-themed numbers game!

This app begins with index.html and functions with the game.js file in assets/javascript

Choose a character to play as.
Now, you must defeat all the other characters.
Each character has a unique amount of health and attack power
You can fight them in any order you'd like.

With each successful hit, the number for your attack power will double.
The amount of health an animal has will go down by the number of attack power it was hit with.

If you fight your enemies wisely, in the correct order, you will win the game!
If not, you will run out of health and be devoured.

May the odds be in your favor.
